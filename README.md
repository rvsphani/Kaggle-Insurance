# Welcome to NJDataScience Meetup's Kaggle Insurance Repo.

Here we'll all try to push our analyses, explanations, and code related to our work and findings on the Kaggle's "Porto Seguro's Safe Driver Prediction". You can find all the relevant information at the project page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction).

## Tools

I imagine for the most part we'll use Python's standard data analysis libraries:
|  Tools  |  Links  | Uses |
|---------|---------|------|
| NumPy   | [**Link**](http://www.numpy.org/) | Standard math library, basis for most other Py libs |
| SciPy | [**Link**](https://www.scipy.org/) | Standard Science library, using NumPy |
| Pandas | [**Link**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandas) | The Standard Data Analysis library. If you're not sure where to start, try here first. |
| Scikit Learn | [**Link**](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) | Python's Starting Machine Learning library. *Requires* NumPy, SciPy, MatPlotLib |
| Keras | [**Link**](https://keras.io/) | Neural Network and Deep Learning library. You should be familiar with some of the above before this one.|
| MatPlotLib | [**Link**](https://matplotlib.org/) | The Go-To Plotting library |
| Jupyter | [**Link**](http://jupyter.org/index.html) | Used for Demoing your code, or creating a walkthrough with step-by-step instructions. |


If you need a refresher on Git, [here](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/)'s a nifty cheat sheet for review. If on the other hand you need a more thorough understanding and arent' afraid of reading a bit, read Git's online book [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## Project Information

As far as the organization here goes, we will each create our own folder to work here, though I encourage everyone to also use their own branch when messing around with the data and whatever they're planning to do here - just in case you make a mistake and want to reverse it quick (which also means committing often).

The data relevant for this project will be in a common data folder, left in the master branch. This way everyone can access what they need without going to the project page or their own separate folders every time they work with this repo.

That's it for now - if anyone has comments or suggestions let us know during the meeting, or create a branch with them and do a merge request!

### Good luck everyone!
